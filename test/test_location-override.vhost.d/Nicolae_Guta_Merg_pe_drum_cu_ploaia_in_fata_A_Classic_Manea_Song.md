The song was released in 2010 and has over 8.5 million views on YouTube[^2^]. It features Guta's distinctive voice and style, with catchy melodies, emotional lyrics and a fast tempo. The song tells the story of how Guta misses his former lover and how he wanders on the road with the rain in his face, hoping to find her again. He also blames himself for losing her and asks for forgiveness.
 
The chorus of the song goes like this:

> Merg pe drum cu ploaia in fata
 Si ma gandesc la tine
 Merg pe drum cu ploaia in fata
 Si nu te pot uita
 Merg pe drum cu ploaia in fata
 Si plang ca un copil
 Merg pe drum cu ploaia in fata
 Si te iubesc la fel

Which translates to:

> I walk on the road with the rain in front of me
 And I think of you
 I walk on the road with the rain in front of me
 And I can't forget you
 I walk on the road with the rain in front of me
 And I cry like a child
 I walk on the road with the rain in front of me
 And I love you the same

The song is a typical example of manea, a genre that emerged in Romania in the late 1980s and early 1990s, influenced by Turkish, Arabic and Balkan music. Manea is often associated with the Roma community, as many of its performers and fans belong to this ethnic group. Manea is also known for its themes of love, betrayal, jealousy, money and partying.

## The History of Manele in Romania: From Turkish Dance to Pop Folk Phenomenon
 
Manele music has a long and complex history in Romania, dating back to the late 18th and early 19th century, when it emerged as a genre of dance music brought by Roma from Istanbul. [^1^] At that time, Romania was under Turkish suzerainty, and manea was a word used to describe a type of Turkish dance without lyrics.  Some of these classical manele have been adapted over the years and are still performed by traditional Roma musicians called lÄutari.
 
In the 1960s, a new type of manea appeared, by adding lyrics to the geampara, a lÄutaresc genre of Turkish origin. [^1^] These manele were influenced by Romanian folk music, Aromanian folk music, Greek music and Balkan brass music. They were sung by lÄutari such as Romica Puceanu, Gabi LuncÄ and Ion Onoriu. They were also popularized by singers such as Maria TÄnase and GicÄ Petrescu.
 
The modern manele emerged in the 1980s and early 1990s, as translations and imitations of Turkish and Arabic songs. [^1^] A well-known Romanian manele singer, Adrian Copilul Minune, traces it to a genre known as "turceasca" (Turkish). [^2^] The modern manele also incorporated elements from Greek music, Bulgarian music, Serbian music and Arabesque music. They used modern electronic instruments and beats, creating a pop folk sound that appealed to a large audience. Some of the pioneers of this style were Nicolae GuÈÄ, Costi IoniÈÄ, Florin Salam and Vali Vijelie.
 
Manele music has been controversial since its inception, as it has been criticized for its low quality, plagiarism, vulgarity and negative influence on Romanian culture. Many radio and television channels or media boycott manele music. [^1^] Manele singers have been accused of copying songs from Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey without giving credit. [^2^] Manele lyrics have been denounced for their themes of love, money, enemies, alcoholism and violence. Manele fans have been stereotyped as uneducated, poor and criminal. Manele music has also been associated with the Roma community, which faces discrimination and marginalization in Romania.
 
Despite the criticism, manele music has also been defended as a form of cultural expression and resistance for marginalized groups. Some scholars have argued that manele music reflects the social realities and aspirations of its performers and listeners, who face exclusion and inequality in post-communist Romania.  Manele music has also been praised for its creativity, diversity and vitality, as it constantly adapts to new influences and trends. Manele music has also influenced other genres of Romanian music, such as hip hop, rock and folk.
